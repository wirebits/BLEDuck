# BLEDuck
Setup for ESP32-S3 boards to make a BLE-enabled USB Rubber Ducky.

# Key Features
- Minimal Setup.
- Simply controlled by Serial Bluetooth Terminal App.
- Execute payloads by just sending numbers.

# OS Support
- Windows 10
- Android

# Recommended
- Use those ESP32-S3 boards which has at least `8MB` flash memory.

# Setup of ESP32-S3
1. Open Official CircuitPython download link from [here](https://circuitpython.org/downloads).
2. Search `ESP32-S3`.
3. Select your board and click on it.
4. At the end of the page, there is button named `DOWNLOAD BOOTLOADER ZIP`.
5. Click on it to download.
6. Open that ZIP file.
7. There is a file named `combined.bin`.
8. Open Adafruit ESP Web Flasher from [here](https://adafruit.github.io/Adafruit_WebSerial_ESPTool/).
9. Connect ESP32-S3 with a USB cable.
10. Connect to the PC/Laptop.
11. Press and hold the `BOOT` button.
12. Press and release the `RST` button.
13. Release the `BOOT` button.
14. Set the Baud Rate to `460800 Baud`.
15. Click on `Connect` button.
16. Select your Device COM Port in the Pop-Up Window.
17. Click on `Connect` button in the Pop-Up Window.
   - When connected successfully, then it show this ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3dd86d85-df80-4d58-aba5-e078dc30212c)
18. Click on `Erase` button.
19. Wait for sometimes to successfully erased.
20. Click on first one `Choose a file...`.
21. Select the `combined.bin` file.
22. Click on `Program` button.
23. Wait for sometimes and after successfully flashed, press and release the `RST` button.
24. Plug-out and then plug-in the USB cable.
   - When it connects, then ESP32-S3 board as a removable storage device `S3DKC1BOOT`.
25. Done! Now, ESP32-S3 Board is ready to flash CircuitPython `.uf2` file.

# Setup of Circuit Python
1. Open Official CircuitPython download link from [here](https://circuitpython.org/downloads).
2. Search `ESP32-S3`.
3. Select your board and click on it.
4. Download latest CircuitPython `.uf2` file.
4. Copy the `.uf2` file into the `S3DKC1BOOT`.
   - When it is copied, then it disconnects automatically and reconnect as `CIRCUITPY`.
   - Means CircuitPython is successfully flashed in the ESP32-S3 board.
5. Open `CIRCUITPY`.
   - There are two important things in it : `lib` folder and `code.py` file.
6. Download latest Adafruit CircuitPython Bundle from [here](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/releases).
7. Extarct the ZIP file.
8. Go to the `lib` folder in the extracted ZIP file.
9. Copy `adafruit_ble` and `adafruit_hid` folders in the `lib` folder of `CIRCUITPY`.
10. Done! Now, ESP32-S3 board is ready to use as a BLEDuck.

# CIRCUITPY Directory Structure
- **CIRCUITPY/**
  - **lib/**
      - `adafruit_ble`
      - `adafruit_hid`
  - `code.py`
  - `payload_X.txt`
  - where `X` is a number like `1`,`2`,`3`,`4` etc.

# Install and Run
1. Download or Clone the Repository.
2. Open the folder.
3. Make sure that your ESP32-S3 board is connected to your PC/Laptop.
5. Copy `code.py` in the `CIRCUITPY`.
   - It ask for replacement of `code.py` file, then replace it.
   - It will overwrite in the `code.py` file.
   - After 2-3 minutes, an BLE device named `BLEDuck` is discovered.
6. Turn on your mobile bluetooth.
7. Open `Serial Bluetooth Terminal` app.
8. Click on `â˜°`.
9. Click on `Devices`.
10. Click on `Bluetooth LE`.
11. Click on `Scan`.
    - It ask for permission, then click on `Allow`.
    - There is a device named `BLEDuck` show in it.
12. Click on it.
13. After that, when it show `Connected` it means ready to execute payloads using BLE.
14. Just type the number and click on Send button.
    - The payload of that number executes immediately.

# Payload Files
1. Open Notepad or any other text editor.
2. Write your payload in it.
3. When saving the file, select `CIRCUITPY`.
4. Name the payload as `payload_1`, `payload_2` etc.
   - It is saved by default as `.txt` files.

# Mnemonic Table
| Mnemonics | Description | Example  |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| WAIT      | It add time in the code.<br>Time is in milliseconds.<br>1000 ms = 1 second. | WAIT 1000 |
| TYPE      | It add text want to type in the code. | TYPE Hello World! |
| LOOP      | It runs commands for a certain number of times.<br> Synatx is `LOOP number-of-times commands` | LOOP 3<br>TYPE Hello World!<br>EXIT<br><br>LOOP 4<br>TAB<br>EXIT<br><br>LOOP 1<br>CTRL S<br>EXIT<br><br>LOOP 1<br>CTRL SHIFT N<br>EXIT<br> |
| INF       | It run commans infinitely.<br>Syntax is `INF commands` | INF<br>TYPE Hello World!<br>EXIT<br><br>INF<br>TAB<br>EXIT<br> |

# Special Symbols
1. `-`
- It is used to put the cursor in the next line.
- It is only used with TYPE.
- Example : `TYPE Hello World!-`
- If TYPE contain any command and then `-` then it run automatically without `ENTER` key.
